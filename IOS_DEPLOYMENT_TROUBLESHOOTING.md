# iOS Deployment Troubleshooting Guide

## Issue: Changes Not Appearing in iOS App

The iOS app builds successfully but UI changes (Settings menu, game reset functionality) are not appearing in the deployed app.

## Root Cause Analysis

1. **Build Pipeline Issue**: Changes are building correctly in development but may not be syncing to iOS bundle
2. **Cache Issues**: iOS app may be caching old JavaScript/CSS files
3. **Capacitor Sync Problem**: Built assets may not be properly copied to iOS project

## Implemented Solutions (v2.0.15)

### 1. Enhanced Build Pipeline
- Added aggressive cache cleaning: `rm -rf dist/` before build
- Added Capacitor cache clearing: `npx cap clean ios`
- Added forced sync: `npx cap sync ios --force`

### 2. Cache Busting
- Added meta tags for cache control in HTML:
  ```html
  <meta name="app-version" content="2.0.15" />
  <meta name="build-number" content="20" />
  <meta http-equiv="Cache-Control" content="no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate" />
  <meta http-equiv="Pragma" content="no-cache" />
  <meta http-equiv="Expires" content="0" />
  ```

### 3. Build Verification
- Added JavaScript bundle verification in deployment pipeline
- Check for Settings component in built assets
- Verify version numbers are synced to iOS bundle

### 4. Version Logging
- Added console logging in main.tsx for deployment verification
- Version info logged on app startup for debugging

## Verification Steps

When the next deployment completes, check:

1. **CodeMagic Build Logs**: Look for "Settings found in bundle" confirmations
2. **iOS App Console**: Should show "ðŸš€ Pumpkin Patch v2.0.15 build 20 loaded"
3. **Settings Button**: Should appear at bottom of map screen
4. **Reset Functionality**: Settings > Reset should work without "Unable to reset" error

## Next Steps if Issue Persists

1. **Manual Capacitor Sync**: Run locally then commit iOS folder changes
2. **Bundle Analysis**: Inspect actual iOS bundle files for Settings component
3. **Alternative Cache Busting**: Add query parameters to asset URLs
4. **Deployment Environment**: Check if production environment has different build settings

## Technical Details

- **JavaScript Bundle**: Settings component confirmed in `index-Lf1AVeoD.js`
- **Database Methods**: `clearAllPlayerPlots` and `clearAllPlayerOvens` implemented
- **API Endpoints**: Complete reset endpoint working in development
- **UI Component**: Settings dialog with confirmation working in development
