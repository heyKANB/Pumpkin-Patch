# TestFlight Deployment Issues & Solutions

## Problem Identified
TestFlight version 2.0.9 (build 14) does not reflect recent development changes:
- Bonus coins not distributed (players still have original coin amounts)
- Daily coins reset button missing
- Farm layout spacing issues persist  
- Field expansion limitations not fixed

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Environment Mismatch**: TestFlight production uses different database than development
2. **Build Process**: CodeMagic CI/CD was building outdated version (2.0.9 build 14)
3. **Database Instance**: Production and development use separate PostgreSQL instances

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Version Update (✓ Complete)
- Updated version from 2.0.9 build 14 → 2.0.10 build 15
- Updated `codemagic.yaml` and `replit.md` for consistency

### 2. Database Strategy
- Development: Uses Replit's PostgreSQL instance
- Production: May use different database instance in CodeMagic deployment
- **Action Required**: Ensure production database gets same bonus coin distribution

### 3. Environment Debug Endpoint (✓ Added)
- Created `/api/debug/environment` to verify production environment
- Shows version, database connection, player data, feature flags

### 4. Build Verification (✓ Complete)
- Fixed duplicate `unlockNextLevel` methods causing build warnings
- Verified production build completes successfully
- Assets properly generated in `dist/public/`

## Next Steps for TestFlight v2.0.10

### For Development Team:
1. **Trigger New Build**: Commit changes to trigger CodeMagic build 15
2. **Production Database**: Apply bonus coins to production database:
   ```sql
   UPDATE players SET coins = coins + 25;
   ```
3. **Environment Verification**: Test `/api/debug/environment` in TestFlight
4. **Feature Verification**: Test all recent features in TestFlight build

### Verification Checklist for TestFlight v2.0.10:
- [ ] Version shows 2.0.10 build 15
- [ ] Players have bonus coins (39-55 coins range)
- [ ] Daily coins reset button functional
- [ ] Farm layout spacing fixed
- [ ] Field expansion works beyond 3x3
- [ ] Database persistence functional

## CodeMagic Configuration
- Build process: `NODE_ENV=production npm run build`
- Assets path: `dist/public/` (confirmed correct)
- Database: Ensure production `DATABASE_URL` is properly configured
- Version: Now set to 2.0.10 build 15

## Database Migration Strategy
Since production and development use separate databases:
1. Apply same bonus coin distribution to production database
2. Ensure schema consistency between environments
3. Verify player initialization works in production

## Emergency Rollback
If v2.0.10 has issues:
1. Revert `codemagic.yaml` to previous stable version
2. Use Replit rollback functionality for code changes
3. Restore database snapshot if needed
